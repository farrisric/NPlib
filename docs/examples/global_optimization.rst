Global Optimization Tutorial
=============================

This tutorial demonstrates the global optimization process using the `chemical_ordering_global_opt.ipynb` notebook.

.. note::

    Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebook.

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial, we will explore the global optimization techniques applied to chemical ordering. The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Setting up the initial parameters and configurations.
2. **Optimization**: Running the optimization algorithm.
3. **Analysis**: Analyzing the results of the optimization.

Initialization
--------------

First, we need to import the necessary libraries and set up the initial parameters.

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from some_library import initialize_parameters

    # Initialize parameters
    params = initialize_parameters()

Optimization
------------

Next, we run the optimization algorithm. This step involves multiple iterations to find the optimal configuration.

.. code-block:: python

    from some_library import run_optimization

    # Run optimization
    results = run_optimization(params)

Analysis
--------

Finally, we analyze the results to understand the performance of the optimization.

.. code-block:: python

    from some_library import analyze_results

    # Analyze results
    analysis = analyze_results(results)

    # Plot the results
    plt.plot(analysis)
    plt.show()

Conclusion
----------

This tutorial provided an overview of the global optimization process for chemical ordering. For more details, refer to the `chemical_ordering_global_opt.ipynb` notebook.
