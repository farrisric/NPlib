NPL - Nanoparticle Library
===========================

Overview
--------

`NPL` is a Python library for the simulation and structural optimization of nanoparticles, specifically tailored for bimetallic nanoparticles. Built on the robust `ASE` (Atomic Simulation Environment), it enables users to easily set up and analyze complex nanoparticle structures across a range of chemical compositions and structures. `NPL` provides high-level abstractions, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced researchers aiming to perform detailed nanoparticle simulations.
